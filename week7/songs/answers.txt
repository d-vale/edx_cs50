Question 1: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

To figure out this person's audio aura, I'd look at the average energy, valence, and danceability scores from their top 100 songs.

Based on what I see in the data, this listener seems to have pretty mainstream tastes - lots of popular hits from 2018. The energy levels are generally high, which tells me they like music that gets them going. The valence (happiness factor) also seems decent, so they're not really into super depressing stuff.

What's interesting is the mix - you've got everything from Drake to Post Malone to songs with features, which shows they don't stick to just one genre. If I had to characterize their aura, I'd say it's something like "Mainstream Mood Booster" - they want music that sounds good, feels good, and probably works well for parties or just hanging out.

The high danceability scores suggest this person actually moves to their music, whether that's in the car, at the gym, or just vibing at home. They're not looking for complex emotional journeys - they want songs that hit right away and make them feel good.

Question 2: Hypothesize about why the way you've calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Honestly, this method is pretty flawed when you think about it.

The biggest issue is that we're treating every song the same way. Like, if I played "God's Plan" by Drake 500 times but only listened to some random song once, they both count equally in this calculation. That's ridiculous - my actual favorite songs should matter way more.

Also, people change throughout the year! Maybe I was going through a breakup in March and listened to a bunch of sad songs, but by summer I was back to party music. This method just mashes everything together and loses all that context.

Plus, let's be real - sometimes you play music for different reasons. My workout playlist is totally different from my study music, which is different from what I play when friends are over. But this analysis acts like I'm the same person in every situation.

Here's what would actually work better:

- Weight songs by how many times they were actually played, not just if they made the top 100
- Look at when during the year certain types of songs were popular for this person
- Maybe split it into different "modes" - like Weekend Party Person vs Weekday Chill Person
- Consider what time of day songs were played (morning commute music hits different than late night music)
- Look at whether songs were played solo or added to collaborative playlists
- Factor in if songs were skipped a lot vs played all the way through

Basically, actual human listening behavior is way messier and more interesting than what simple averages can capture. People aren't just one musical personality - we're complicated!
